The issue is that the accounts dictionary in db.py is in-memory only — meaning each time you run a new CLI command, it reloads the script from scratch, and the accounts dictionary is empty again.

That’s because Typer apps (and CLI commands in general) don’t persist memory across runs. We need a simple persistent storage — such as writing to a JSON file between runs.
