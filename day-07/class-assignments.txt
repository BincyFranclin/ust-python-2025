Review: Guess my number game

Session 1: [40]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Demo. Design a Word Jumble Game and implement in python
   The game should consist of atleast 10 words to begin with
    Jumbled Word: "otpcomure"
    Your Guess: "computer"
    ✅ Correct! 

    Note: Use Unicode charecter to print the tick marks
    Example: print("\U00002705 Correct!")
    Sample words should come from a file

1. Based on the above code   

   Give players two attempts
   If the player guesses in the first attempt give 2 points, in the second attempt 1 points, otherwise 0
   Allow players to get hints/clues if they fail to guess in the first attempt
   Give the result based on total points, total first attempts, total second attempts
   Use appropriate unicode charecters

   Example: 'alepp'
             Can you guess? ape 
             CLUE: 'This is a fruit'
             Take a second guess? apple
             ✅ Correct! 

             ...

             Total          = 18
             First          = 5
             Second         = 8
             Overall        = B+

   Challenge: Keep the hints in the file. How to read the the words and hints from a file and integrate it
            Come up with a logic to display the result
